<h2 align="center"><b>VideoDL</b></h2>

<h4 align="center">Download and watch videos ad-free from 100+ sites using youtube-dl.</h4>

Built with [youtube-dl](https://https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [youtube-dl-android](https://github.com/yausername/youtubedl-android).

# Usage

In SmartCookieWeb 13.0+, navigate to the video page and press the download button in the navbar. The page to download the video will open.

In lower versions of the browser, open the dropdown menu, choose the "Share" option, and select SmartCookieWeb-ytdl.

# Features

- Download videos from hundreds of sites in various resolutions
- ~Stream videos from YouTube without ads~ (coming soon)
- ~Intergration with SmartCookieWeb download manager~ (coming soon)

# Why is this a seperate app?

1) Adding youtube-dl alone into SmartCookieWeb would increase the app size by 10MB, so instead of increasing the app size to add a feature most users won't use, it's split into a seperate app

2) Google Play doesn't allow apps that can download videos from YouTube on Google Play
